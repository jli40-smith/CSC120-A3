Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with Zoe Plumridge and Jialu Guo (Lucy)

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I went to the 7PM to 9PM session on Tuesday (9/20) to work out a problem with junit which was keeping me from starting the warmup assignment. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
The syntax is hard to learn and more fussy than Python, but it has many similarities with Python that I can rely on to help with my code. I think that once I got used to it, it became easier to distinguish code blocks via braces and semicolons rather than with white space. Java forced me to really understand what delineated/"counted as" individual statements or code blocks on a logical level. In Python, I just kind of indented and hoped for the best.
The hierarchy in Java does seem different from Python, but I got used accessing and creating methods inside other classes. 
I had trouble understanding the main class, but now I can see how it is analogous to the main function in Python, and the way 
one should create methods or functions outside of main to organize their code. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I might conclude that programming comes in a lot of different styles, and you often have to pick up new skills or 
languages to do different tasks. It seems both interesting and intimidating, but I also have read that computer science careers can involve constant self-learning-- and this assignment has been my first experience with that! 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
