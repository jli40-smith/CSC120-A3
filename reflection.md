Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with Zoe Plumridge, Katie Wilson, Kathleen Bacigalupi, Jialu (Lucy) Guo (is not done with assignment yet)

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I went to the 7PM to 9PM session on Tuesday (9/20) to work out a problem with junit which was keeping me from starting the warmup assignment (It might also have been Wednesday 9/21 if my memory was incorrect). I also went to the 1-3PM TA hours on Sunday, 9/25 (certain, this time!).

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
The syntax is hard to learn and more fussy than Python, but it has many similarities with Python that I can rely on to help with my code. I think that once I got used to it, it became easier to distinguish code blocks via braces and semicolons rather than with white space. Java forced me to really understand what "counted as" individual statements or code blocks on a logical level. In Python, I guessed where to indent and hoped for the best since whitespaces indicated code blocks. I had to be more intentional with indenting to Java to make my code 
readable. 

The hierarchy in Java does seem different from Python, but I got used accessing and creating methods inside other classes. 
I had trouble understanding the main class, but now I can see how it is analogous to the main function in Python, and the way 
one should create methods or functions outside of main to organize their code. In Python, I was prone to writing longer and more 
repetitive procedural code. 

I like the way Java is organized in an object-oriented way, and enjoyed splitting up my code into different methods for easier maintenance and better readability. I also feel like I prefer working with the compiler to using Python's interpreter, as it makes it possible to catch bugs before running code. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I might conclude that programming comes in a lot of different styles, and you often have to pick up new skills or 
languages to do different tasks. It seems both interesting and intimidating, but I also have read that computer science careers can involve constant self-learning-- and this assignment has been my first experience with that! I can also conclude that some programming languages will use similar logic and have "analogous" methods or operators that will use different names and syntax-- and one may have to read documentation or search for help on the Internet to relearn familiar tools for a new language.  

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was that I was able to write Java code that ran properly, and set aside time to watch additional Java tutorials on Youtube 
so that I understood Java syntax and the use of for loops, if/else statements, the main method, and other parts of Java.
I was also able to get help with reducing the length and improving the organization of my code from speaking with TAs and other students. 
I got a good idea for implementing the canned response and for mirroring words. 

What did not work was that I could not reduce the repetitiveness of the word replacement method I created (mirrorWords()) by writing another method for replacing words (How would it work with the if/else logic?), and I could not think of a fool proof way to resolve the I/me problem other than replacing the final "I" in a string with "me." I also did  not finish with enough time to work on all the Kudos elements of the assignment, and I may have had time if I started this homework earlier. 

I would advise any taking this course to review Java syntax before starting CSC-120, and practice writing simpler functions. ALex Lee on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexLeeYT/videos) was a great resource I used to help me learn.
